# TASK-3
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the Iris dataset to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships among its features. The dataset consists of four numerical attributes—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—and one categorical target variable, species. Histograms were used to analyze the distribution of numerical features, revealing that sepal-related features are fairly symmetric, while petal length and petal width show clearer separation across value ranges, indicating their strong discriminative power. Count plots were applied to the categorical feature to examine class distribution, which showed that all three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—are equally represented, indicating a balanced dataset. Box plots were used to identify outliers in the numerical features, where only minor outliers were observed, particularly in sepal width, suggesting minimal need for outlier treatment. A correlation heatmap was generated to study relationships between features, which revealed a strong positive correlation between petal length and petal width, moderate correlation between sepal length and petal features, and weak correlation involving sepal width. Insights from these visualizations indicate that petal-related features provide better separation between species compared to sepal features. Based on the analysis, petal length and petal width are identified as the most important features for prediction, followed by sepal length, while sepal width contributes the least. Overall, the Iris dataset is clean, balanced, and well-suited for classification tasks, making it ideal for building and evaluating machine learning models
